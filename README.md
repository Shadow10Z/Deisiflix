# Deisiflix

This project aims to develop an application in Java, that is capable of receiving and responding to requests for statistics on a movie database.

The program will have to read data from this database, which will be provided from files in CSV - comma separated values format (deisi_actores.txt, deisi_genres.txt, deisi_movies_votes.txt, deisi_movies.txt).

# Objectives

-> Definition and implementation of Java classes to represent the entities of the problem reality/domain.

-> Implementation of Reading Files (CSV) that are the program's input.

-> Creation of objects in memmory, considering the files read.

-> Support for the input of "questions" (or queries) that will be asked to the database and for the calculation and presentation of the respective results.
